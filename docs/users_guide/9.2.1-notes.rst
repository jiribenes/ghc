.. _release-9-2-1:

Version 9.2.1
==============

Highlights
----------

* GHC now has much better support  for :extension:`impredicative types
  <ImpredicativeTypes>`, as described in *A quick look at impredicativity*
  (ICFP 2020).

Compiler
~~~~~~~~

- New '-Wredundant-bang-patterns' flag that enables checks for "dead" bangs.
  For instance, given this program: ::

      f :: Bool -> Bool
      f True = False
      f !x   = x

  GHC would report that the bang on ``x`` is redundant and can be removed
  since the argument was already forced in the first equation. For more
  details see :ghc-flag:`-Wredundant-bang-patterns`
